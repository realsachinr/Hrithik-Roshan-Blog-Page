                <h1>Hrithik Roshan</h1>
                <p>Hrithik Roshan (pronounced [ɾɪt̪ɪk ɾoʃən];[1] born 10 January 1974) is an Indian actor who works in Hindi cinema. He has portrayed a variety of characters and is known for his dancing skills. One of the highest-paid actors in India, he has won many awards, including six Filmfare Awards, of which four were for Best Actor. Starting from 2012, he has appeared in Forbes India's Celebrity 100 several times based on his income and popularity.</p>
                <p>Roshan has frequently collaborated with his father, Rakesh Roshan. He made brief appearances as a child actor in several films in the 1980s and later worked as an assistant director on four of his father's films. His first leading role was in the box-office success Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai (2000), for which he received several awards. Performances in the 2000 terrorism drama Fiza and the 2001 ensemble family drama Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... consolidated his reputation but were followed by several poorly received films.</p>

                <p>Roshan has also performed on stage and debuted on television with the dance reality show Just Dance (2011). As a judge on the latter, he became the highest-paid film star on Indian television at that time. He is involved with a number of humanitarian causes, endorses several brands and products and has launched his own clothing line. Roshan was married for fourteen years to Sussanne Khan, with whom he has two children.</p>

                <h2>Early life and background</h2>
                <p>Roshan was born on 10 January 1974 in Bombay to the Roshan family, prominent in Hindi cinema.[2] He is of Punjabi and Bengali descent on his paternal side. Hrithik's paternal grandmother Ira Roshan was a Bengali.[3][4][5] His father, film director Rakesh Roshan, is the son of music director Roshanlal Nagrath; his mother, Pinkie, is the daughter of producer and director J. Om Prakash. His uncle, Rajesh, is a music composer.[2] Roshan has an older sister, Sunaina, and was educated at the Bombay Scottish School.[6] Roshan belongs to a Hindu family, though he considers himself more spiritual than religious.[7][8]</p>
                <p>Roshan felt isolated as a child; he was born with an extra thumb fused to the one on his right hand, which led some of his peers to avoid him.[10] He has stammered since the age of six; this caused him problems at school, and he feigned injury and illness to avoid oral tests.[11] He was helped by daily speech therapy.[11][12]</p>

                <h3>2000–2002: Debut, success and setback</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Roshan was originally scheduled to make his screen debut as a lead actor opposite Preity Zinta in a cancelled film – Shekhar Kapur's Tara Rum Pum Pum.[24] Instead, he starred in his father's romantic drama Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai (2000) opposite another debutante, Ameesha Patel. Roshan played dual roles: Rohit, an aspiring singer brutally killed after witnessing a murder, and Raj, an NRI who falls in love with Patel's character.[25] To prepare, he trained with the actor Salman Khan to bulk up physically,[26] worked to improve his diction and took lessons in acting, singing, dancing, fencing and riding.[27] With global revenues of ₹800 million (US$10 million),[28] Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai became one of the highest-grossing Indian films of 2000.[29] His performance was acclaimed by critics;[21][30] Suggu Kanchana on Rediff.com wrote, "[Roshan] is good. The ease and style with which he dances, emotes, fights, makes one forget this is his debut film ... He seems to be the most promising among the recent lot of star sons we have been subjected to."[25] For the role, Roshan received Best Male Debut and Best Actor Awards at the annual Filmfare Awards, IIFA Awards, and Zee Cine Awards.[31] He became the first actor to win both Filmfare Best Debut and Best Actor awards the same year.[32] The film established Roshan as a prominent actor in Bollywood.[33] The actor found life hard after his overnight success, particularly the demands on his time.[34]</p>
                <br><h3>2003–2008: Revival and awards success</h3>
                <p>oshan's career began to revive with a starring role in Koi... Mil Gaya (2003).[21][51] The film, directed and produced by his father, centers on his character Rohit Mehra, a developmentally disabled young man, who comes in contact with an extraterrestrial being—a role that required him to lose nearly 8 kilograms (18 lb). Roshan recalls the experience of starring in the film fondly: "I could live my childhood [again]. I could eat as many chocolates as I wanted. I became a baby and everybody was so caring towards me."[52] In the book Film Sequels, Carolyn Jess-Cooke drew similarities between the character and Forrest Gump, portrayed by Tom Hanks in the titular film, but this idea was dismissed by Roshan.[52][53] Film critics were polarised on their view of the film—some of them negatively compared its storyline to the 1982 Hollywood release E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial—but were unanimous in their praise for Roshan.[18][54] In a 2010 retrospective of the Top 80 Iconic Performances of Bollywood, Filmfare noted "how flesh and blood Hrithik's act is. Simply because he believes he is the part. Watch him laugh, cry or bond with his remote controlled alien friend and note his nuanced turn."[55] A Rediff.com critic agreed that Roshan was "the turbojet that propels the film to the realm of the extraordinary."[56] Koi... Mil Gaya was one of the most popular Bollywood films of the year, earning ₹823.3 million (US$10 million) worldwide and Roshan won both Filmfare Awards for Best Actor and Best Actor (Critics).[37][57]</p>

If I allow myself to get affected by all this hype, I'll stunt my growth as an actor and be damned for life. I know that I still have a long way to go before I can even aspire to equal the achievements of any of the superstars. I know I am good at my job, and I am sure I will be damn good one day but right now, I also know how bad I can be."
